# YOLOv8 Image Recognition

This repository contains the implementation of YOLOv8 for image recognition tasks.

## Project Description

This project uses the pre-trained YOLOv8 model for image recognition.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- CUDA (if you're using GPU)

#### 1. Install necessary packages
#### 2. Load YOLOv8 model: Load the pre-trained YOLOv8 model provided by Ultralytics.
#### 3. Perform object recognition on an image
#### 4. Make some arragement about the image preprocessing process
#### 5.  Adjust Confidence and NMS Thresholds
